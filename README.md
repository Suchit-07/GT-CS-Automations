# GT-CS-Automations
Small tampermonkey automations to make GT CS work easier

* `GT_CS_Open_Window.js` adds a button to open an iframe in a new tab. It's way faster to go through the entire chapter and open each part in a new tab so everything can load at the same time.

* `GT_CS_Scroll_To_Questions.js` adds a button that automatically scrolls to the next question. (Note: this works way better in the new tab with the iframe because the button actually stays on screen when you scroll)

> Note: Pretty sure this isn't against the honor policy (Just scrolls to the next question) but I have no clue. Use at your own risk.
